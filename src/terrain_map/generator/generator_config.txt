# Configuration File Explanation for Gradient Skier Map Generator

This file explains each parameter in `generator_config.json`. Understanding these
will allow you to fine-tune the terrain to your exact specifications.

## Shelter & Traps (The Valleys)

These parameters control the main "shelter" basin and the smaller "trap" basins.

- "SHELTER_DEPTH": How deep the main shelter valley is. Higher values create a deeper hole.
- "SHELTER_WIDTH": The overall size (radius) of the shelter valley before warping.

- "TRAP_DENSITY": A ratio determining how many traps appear relative to the map's area. (e.g., 0.0005 means 5 traps per 10,000 pixels).
- "TRAP_DEPTH_MIN_RATIO": The shallowest a trap can be, as a percentage of `SHELTER_DEPTH`. (e.g., 0.5 means a trap can be at least 50% as deep as the shelter).
- "TRAP_DEPTH_MAX_RATIO": The deepest a trap can be, as a percentage of `SHELTER_DEPTH`.
- "TRAP_WIDTH_MIN": The smallest possible size (radius) for a trap basin.
- "TRAP_WIDTH_MAX": The largest possible size (radius) for a trap basin.

## Basin Warping (Making Valleys Irregular)

This is the key to making your circular valleys look like natural, irregular depressions.
It works by distorting the coordinates before the valley is drawn.

- "BASIN_WARP_OCTAVES": Layers of detail in the warp noise. More octaves = more complex and wiggly edges on your valleys.
- "BASIN_WARP_FREQUENCY": The "zoom level" of the warp noise. Higher values create smaller, more frequent wiggles. Lower values create larger, smoother distortions.
- "BASIN_WARP_AMPLITUDE": The **strength** of the distortion. This is the most important value for controlling irregularity. A value of 0 gives a perfect circle; a high value gives a very chaotic shape.

## Ridge Generation (The Mountains)

This system uses a "masking" technique. Think of it as painting a large, soft, elliptical area (the "mask") where you want a mountain range to be, and then filling that area with detailed, rocky noise.

- "RIDGE_RANGES_MIN" / "_MAX": The minimum and maximum number of separate mountain ranges to generate on the map.

- "RIDGE_MASK_LENGTH_MIN" / "_MAX": Controls the length of the elliptical "footprint" for a mountain range.
- "RIDGE_MASK_WIDTH_MIN" / "_MAX": Controls the width of the elliptical "footprint". **To get long, snaking ranges, make the length much larger than the width.**

- "RIDGE_OCTAVES": Layers of detail in the mountain's texture. More octaves create more complex and realistic rock formations.
- "RIDGE_FREQUENCY": The jaggedness of the mountains. Higher values create more, smaller, sharper peaks packed together.
- "RIDGE_AMPLITUDE": The **height** of the mountains. Higher values create taller, more dramatic peaks and clifftops.

## Detail Noise (Overall Texture)

This adds a final layer of fine-grained, low-intensity noise over the entire map to give everything a slightly rougher, more natural texture.

- "DETAIL_NOISE_OCTAVES": Layers of detail for the texture.
- "DETAIL_NOISE_FREQUENCY": The "grain" of the texture. Higher frequency = finer grain.
- "DETAIL_NOISE_AMPLITUDE": The height of the texture. **Keep this value low**, otherwise it will overwhelm the larger features you've created.

## General Settings

- "START_ALTITUDE_THRESHOLD": A gameplay value. It defines how high a point on the map must be (on the 0-255 scale) to be considered a valid starting position for the skier.
